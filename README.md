#### ABOUT THE CODE

Implemented a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for any given CNF sentences.

#### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Suppose you have a wedding to plan, and want to arrange the wedding seating for a certain
number of guests in a hall. The hall has a certain number of tables for seating. Some pairs of
guests are couples or close Friends (F) and want to sit together at the same table. Some other
pairs of guests are Enemies (E) and must be separated into different tables. The rest of the pairs
are Indifferent (I) to each other and do not mind sitting together or not. However, each pair of
guests can have only one relationship, (F), (E) or (I). You must find a seating arrangement that
satisfies all the constraints.

A more detailed description of the problem can be found in WeddingArrangementProblem.pdf.

#### SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Operating System : Windows / Mac OS X

Programming Language: Python 2.7

#### CODE EXECUTION

Update the file input and output path in externalproperties.py. 

Sample input output test cases for testing the code have been provided in Sample test cases folder.

To obtain valid wedding seating arrangement, run WeddingSeatingArrangement.py.

If valid seating exists, the output contains 'yes' followed by the seat assigment for each guest. If no valid seating exists, the program outputs 'no'.
